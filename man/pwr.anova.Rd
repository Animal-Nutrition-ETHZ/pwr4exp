\title{Power calculation for main effects and interactions}
\usage{
pwr.anova(design, alpha, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{a list object containing design name, design data frame, model formula, and a pseudo model object with the expected effect size and variance-covariance components of random effects.}

\item{alpha}{significance level, type I error. default 0.05}

\item{...}{other arguments passed to anova. By default, type III sum of squares and Satterthwaiteâ€™s approximation of denominator degrees of freedom are applied.}
}
\value{
a data frame
}
\description{
Calculate power for testing overall effects of factors and interactions in the form of ANOVA table.
}
