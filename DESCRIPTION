Description: The package provides advanced tools to calculate statistical power and 
    determine sample size for a variety of experimental designs commonly used in agricultural 
    and biological research. Supported designs include completely randomized designs, block designs, 
    and split-plot designs. Emphasizing model specification during power analysis, the package allows
    users to specify main effects, interactions, and contrasts within the models to accurately calculate power.
