Description: The pwr4exp package provides advanced tools to calculate statistical power and 
    determine sample size for a variety of experimental designs commonly used in agricultural 
    and biological research. Supported designs include completely randomized designs, block designs, 
    and split-plot designs. Additionally, pwr4exp offers a flexible framework for performing power analysis 
    on customized designs not predefined in the package. By emphasizing model specification during power analysis, 
    the package allows users to define main effects, interactions, and contrasts within models, enabling more accurate 
    power calculations.
